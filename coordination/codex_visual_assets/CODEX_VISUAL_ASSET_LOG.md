# BEACH COCKTAILS MERGE — CODEX VISUAL ASSET LOG

Append-only execution log for the dedicated visual-production branch.

Do not erase prior factual entries.

For each batch append:
- timestamp;
- task IDs;
- exact output paths;
- generation or protected technical derivation;
- V04 reference(s) used;
- rejected/regenerated attempts;
- QA performed;
- commit SHA;
- remote branch HEAD;
- blockers.

## Initialization

Dedicated visual system created from the owner-approved ScrubBots Codex visual-production workflow and adapted to Beach Cocktails Merge.

V04 masters are the frozen primary visual authority.
V05 production visuals are owner-rejected and are not style authority.

## Batch 001 — global action and frame states

- Timestamp: 2026-09-21 23:10:16 +03:00.
- Tasks: VA-339, VA-340, VA-342, VA-343, VA-344, VA-345, VA-363, VA-364, VA-365, VA-368, VA-376.
- Outputs: `assets/ui_assets/ui/global/button_danger.png`, `button_disabled.png`, `button_locked.png`, `button_primary.png`, `button_secondary.png`, `button_small.png`, `panel_generic_large.png`, `panel_generic_medium.png`, `panel_generic_small.png`, `popup_frame.png`, `tooltip_frame.png`.
- Generation: one separate built-in image-generation operation per distinct asset; no atlas slicing. The V04 `main_menu_master.png` was used as the direct style authority for every operation.
- Technical cleanup: each selected transparent output was resized/padded to its exact master-list dimensions only.
- Rejected/regenerated attempts: none.
- QA: inspected generated button locked and panel variants; verified true RGBA output and exact dimensions (buttons 360x104; panels/frames 440x190). States are materially differentiated: primary emerald, secondary sapphire, disabled pearl/sand, locked sapphire with lock medallion, danger coral, small amber.
- Blockers: none.
- Commit/push: pending batch publication.

## Batch 004 — island-map progression UI

- Timestamp: 2026-09-21 23:10:16 +03:00.
- Tasks: VA-007 through VA-023.
- Outputs: all 17 `assets/ui_assets/campaign/island_map/**` targets in the master list.
- Generation: one separate built-in image-generation operation per distinct crown, panel, connector, node, decoration, chest marker and star asset; V04 `world_map_master.png` was the direct authority.
- Technical cleanup: transparent padding and exact master-list resizing only.
- Rejected/regenerated attempts: none.
- QA: compared locked/unlocked/current/completed/milestone/finale node states, normal/completed connectors, empty/filled stars and top/bottom decorations; verified RGBA output and exact dimensions.
- Blockers: none.
- Commit/push: pending batch publication.

## Batch 003 — reward and star-track states

- Timestamp: 2026-09-21 23:10:16 +03:00.
- Tasks: VA-377 through VA-398.
- Outputs: all `ui/rewards/**` and `ui/star_track/**` targets in the master list.
- Generation: one separate built-in image-generation operation per distinct chest, currency, star, frame, glow and star-track asset; V04 `main_menu_master.png` was the direct authority.
- Technical cleanup: transparent padding and exact master-list resizing only.
- Rejected/regenerated attempts: none.
- QA: verified open/closed chest distinction, empty/filled star distinction, large/small frame distinction, claimed/checkpoint/marker/fill/panel distinction, RGBA output and exact dimensions.
- Blockers: none.
- Commit/push: pending batch publication.

## Batch 002 — global navigation and utility icons

- Timestamp: 2026-09-21 23:10:16 +03:00.
- Tasks: VA-338, VA-341, VA-346, VA-347, VA-353, VA-354, VA-355, VA-356, VA-357, VA-361, VA-366, VA-369.
- Outputs: `back_arrow.png`, `button_icon_round.png`, `check_icon.png`, `close_x.png`, `help_icon.png`, `home_icon.png`, `info_icon.png`, `lock_icon.png`, `map_icon.png`, `next_arrow.png`, `pause_icon.png`, `previous_arrow.png` under `assets/ui_assets/ui/global/`.
- Generation: one separate built-in image-generation operation per icon; V04 `main_menu_master.png` was the direct authority. No V05 art or atlas slicing used.
- Technical cleanup: transparent padding and exact master-list resizing only.
- Rejected/regenerated attempts: none.
- QA: verified isolated RGBA outputs and exact dimensions; utility semantics were checked at mobile icon scale, including directional distinction between back/previous and next arrows, and explicit lock/check/pause symbols.
- Blockers: none.
- Commit/push: pending batch publication.

## Batch 005 — Sunny Cove island pack

- Timestamp: 2026-09-22 00:15:46 +03:00.
- Tasks: VA-102 through VA-114.
- Outputs: all 13 `assets/ui_assets/campaign/islands/sunny_cove/**` targets in the master list.

No V05 art or atlas slicing used.

- Rejected/regenerated attempts: none.
- QA: exact dimensions and RGBA verified for all 13 outputs; representative gameplay background, table material and map title visually inspected; `gameplay_table.png` alpha compared against the canonical mask with zero differing pixels.
